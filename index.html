<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>



<p>Download plugin here: <a href="https://github.com/webbisivut/woocommerce-custom-shipping-methods" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://github.com/webbisivut/woocommerce-custom-shipping-methods</a></p>



<p>On your WordPress dashboard, choose<em> Plugins – Add new.</em></p>



<h2 id="enabling-shipping-method-s">Enabling shipping method(s)</h2>



<p>Choose WooCommerce – Settings – Shipping – One of the shipping zones you wish to use – And add “WooCommerce Custom shipping method” to the zone.</p>



<h2 id="unit-based-shipping">Unit based shipping</h2>



<p>Select “WooCommerce Custom shipping method” by clicking the shipping method’s name to see the plugin settings page.</p>



<p>Unit based shipping allows you to set the pricing based on the cart weight, width, length or height. Pricing is set by using price thresholds.</p>



<p>Below is an example of the settings used for the <em>unit based shipping, </em>which has been setup by using height, weight and width values:</p>



<p>For this example, WooCommerce has been setup to use kilograms for weight units, centimeters for the measurements and euros for pricing. However, you can use what ever units you like to use. This plugin will work with any given units.</p>



<p>Now, if the  cart weight would be less than 1 kg, the plugin would add fee of 5 euros to the total sum. If the total weight exceeds 1 kg but is less than 3 kg, the fee would be 10 euros instead.</p>



<p>Same thing would happen with height. If the cart total height would be 3 centimeters for example, the plugin would add a fee of 15 euros to the total sum.</p>



<p>All these fees would be then calculated together for the total sum. For example if we had a product which height was 3 centimeters and weight 2 kilograms and width of 4 centimeters, the total sum for the unit based fee would be: 15 + 5 + 20 = 40 euros.</p>



<p><strong>Please note!</strong></p>



<p>If the cart total dimensions exceeds the given dimensions in the <em>unit based shipping</em> settings, no fee will be added to the total sum! If you want to hide shipping method if any of the given values exceeds, remember to set the limit to the “Limit settings”, or use fixed price instead.</p>



<h2 id="coupons">Coupons</h2>



<p>Coupons can be used for free shipping. You can specify which coupon codes are available for the shipping method, or you can use any of the coupon codes that has been set to use “free shipping”.</p>



<h2 id="area-based-fees">Area based fees</h2>



<p>Area based fees will be set for the given cities. You can add either a single city or multiple cities, separated by comma.</p>



<h2 id="distance-based-shipping">Distance based shipping</h2>



<p>In order to use the distance based shipping, you need to have a Google Account and you need to generate Google Matrix API key. You also need to have following APIs enabled:</p>



<ul><li>Distance Matrix API</li><li>Places API for Web</li><li>Google Maps Geocoding API</li></ul>



<p>Instructions how to enable APIs can be found here:<br><a href="https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158841?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158841?hl=en</a></p>

<p>Distance based fee can be manipulated by <em>woo_custom_shipping_dbf_calculated_fee </em>filter hook, which takes 4 arguments: $calculatedFee, $kiloMeters, $divider and $price.</p>



<p>The hook function would look something like this:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>function my_dbf_calculated_fee_callback( $calculatedFee, $kiloMeters, $divider, $price ) {<br>if($kiloMeters &lt; 10) {<br>// Do something<br>} else {<br>// Do something else<br>}</p><p>return $calculatedFee;<br>}<br>add_filter( ‘woo_custom_shipping_dbf_calculated_fee’, ‘my_dbf_calculated_fee_callback’, 10, 4 );</p></blockquote>



<p>You can also manipulate the starting address, e.g. in case you want the distance to be calculated on different starting points. Hooks are: <em>woo_custom_shipping_dbf_origin_city_filter</em>, <em>woo_custom_shipping_dbf_origin_zip_filter</em> and <em>woo_custom_shipping_dbf_origin_address_filter</em>.</p>



<p>The hook function would look something like this:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>function my_dbf_calculated_fee_callback( $originAddress ) {</p><p>$originAddress = ‘1234 Fake Street’;</p><p>return $originAddress;<br>}<br>add_filter( ‘<em>woo_custom_shipping_dbf_origin_address_filter</em>‘, ‘my_dbf_calculated_fee_callback’, 10, 1 );</p></blockquote>



<p>You can modify the fee variables with the following filters:</p>



<p><strong>Fixed fee:</strong><br><em>woo_custom_shipping_dbf_fixed_price (takes 2 arguments: $fixedBasePrice and $fixedBasePriceString)</em></p>



<p><strong>Handling costs:</strong><br><em>woo_custom_shipping_dbf_handling_costs</em></p>



<p><strong>Area fee:</strong><br><em>woo_custom_shipping_dbf_area_fee</em></p>



<p><strong>Shipping class fee:</strong><br><em>woo_custom_shipping_dbf_class_amount</em></p>



<p><strong>Free shipping limit:</strong><br><em>woo_custom_shipping_dbf_free_shipping (takes 2 arguments: $fixedBasePrice and $fixedBasePriceString)</em></p>



<p><strong>Cart total:</strong><br><em>woo_custom_shipping_dbf_cart_total_price</em></p>



<p><strong>Total shipping cost:</strong><br><em>woo_custom_shipping_dbf_total_shipping_cost</em></p>



<p>Also <em>wb_woocommerce_custom_rate_filter </em>is available, which allows you to customize the whole calculation logic.</p>
